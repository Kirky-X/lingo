## Release Notes

### Version 0.2.1 (Code Quality & Security Enhancements)

**Code Quality Improvements:**

- **Static Analysis**: Fixed all Clippy warnings for improved code quality
  - Resolved `single_match` patterns in derive macro
  - Fixed boolean assertion patterns (`assert_eq!(x, true)` → `assert!(x)`)
  - Optimized closure usage (`map(|x| x.clone())` → `cloned()`)
  - Improved function parameter types (`&PathBuf` → `&Path`)
  - Added appropriate `#[allow]` attributes for justified cases

- **Error Handling**: Optimized error type sizes
  - Boxed large `figment::Error` variants to reduce memory footprint
  - Improved error message consistency

- **Test Coverage**: Enhanced test reliability
  - Fixed floating-point comparison precision issues
  - Improved module naming conventions
  - Maintained 100% test coverage

**Security Enhancements:**

- **Path Conversion Internalization**: Completed security hardening
  - All path conversion utilities are now internal-only
  - Removed public API exposure of path manipulation tools
  - Enhanced cross-platform path handling security

- **Documentation Updates**: Updated security documentation
  - Added path conversion security section
  - Enhanced security testing documentation
  - Updated security checklist with new requirements

**Development Quality:**

- **Zero Warnings**: All compilation warnings eliminated
- **Dependency Security**: All dependencies verified secure (cargo audit passed)
- **Example Validation**: All examples tested and working correctly

**Breaking Changes:**
- None. All changes are internal improvements maintaining full API compatibility.

### Version 0.2.0 (Configuration Validation Enhancements)

**New Features & Improvements:**

- **Example Configuration Validation**: Added configuration validation demonstrations in production examples
  - `database` example: Enhanced with boundary checking for connection pool, SSL contradictions, and database type validation
  - `web_server` example: Added TLS/CORS configuration validation with warning/error classification
  - `async` example: Implemented multi-service configuration boundary checks with warning notifications

**Validation Strategy:**
- **Error-level validations**: Reserved for configuration contradictions that prevent application startup (e.g., TLS enabled without certificates)
- **Warning-level validations**: Applied to boundary values that may cause performance issues but don't prevent operation (e.g., zero connection pool sizes)
- **Graceful degradation**: Applications continue running with warnings for non-critical configuration issues

**Enhanced Examples:**
- Database connection pool validation: `min_connections` and `max_connections` boundary checks
- Web server TLS/SSL certificate validation and CORS policy checks  
- Async service timeout and resource limit validation
- Comprehensive test coverage for all validation scenarios

**Development Guidelines:**
- Consistent validation patterns across all examples
- Production-ready error handling and logging
- Validation patterns that can be adapted for custom use cases

**Breaking Changes:**
- None. All changes are additive and maintain backward compatibility.

**Migration Guide:**
Existing applications will continue to work without changes. To benefit from validation features:
1. Review configuration files against new validation criteria
2. Monitor application logs for validation warnings
3. Optionally implement custom validation logic using the provided patterns

### Version 0.1.0
This is the initial release of the quantum_config configuration management library. It provides a robust, type-safe, and flexible solution for managing application configuration in Rust projects.

**Key Highlights:**
- Zero-configuration setup with sensible defaults
- Automatic configuration merging from multiple sources
- Compile-time validation of configuration structures
- Rich error reporting for configuration issues
- Extensive documentation and examples

**Getting Started:**
```toml
[dependencies]
quantum_config = "0.2.0"
```

**Basic Usage:**
```rust
use quantum_config::Config;

#[derive(Config)]
struct AppConfig {
    name: String,
    port: u16,
    debug: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let config = AppConfig::load().unwrap();
    println!("Starting {} on port {}", config.name, config.port);
}
```
